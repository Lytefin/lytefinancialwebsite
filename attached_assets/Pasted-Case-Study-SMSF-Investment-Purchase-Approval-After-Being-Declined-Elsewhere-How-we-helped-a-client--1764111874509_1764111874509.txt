Case Study: SMSF Investment Purchase Approval After Being Declined Elsewhere
How we helped a client secure SMSF finance using a 40-year loan term and voluntary contributions overlooked by another broker

Many SMSF trustees miss out on property opportunities because they’re assessed incorrectly or told they don’t qualify. In this case study, we helped a client secure SMSF lending approval—despite another broker advising them they couldn’t borrow the amount they needed.

The Client’s Goal

The client wanted to purchase a residential investment property through their SMSF to diversify their portfolio and strengthen their long-term retirement position.
They had:

A well-funded SMSF

A clear investment objective

A strong property opportunity

However, they were told by a previous broker that the SMSF simply could not borrow enough money to complete the purchase.

The Challenge

The other broker evaluated the SMSF under a standard lending model, which resulted in:

Insufficient borrowing capacity

No consideration of voluntary contributions

No understanding of lenders offering extended 40-year SMSF loan terms

Without exploring specialised SMSF lenders or factoring in allowable contributions, the previous broker incorrectly concluded the client was ineligible.

The client was close to giving up on the property altogether.

Our Strategic Solution
1. A Fresh SMSF Assessment With Specialist Lenders

We reviewed the SMSF’s financials and quickly identified that the previous broker had used restrictive lending assumptions that did not reflect the full range of SMSF lending options available.

2. Leveraging a Lender Offering a 40-Year SMSF Loan Term

We sourced a lender offering a 40-year SMSF loan term, which significantly improved:

Borrowing capacity

Repayment affordability

Long-term SMSF cash flow

This alone increased their borrowing power beyond what they were previously told.

3. Including Voluntary Contributions the Previous Broker Ignored

We identified that the client made regular voluntary concessional contributions—a critical income source for lending that other brokers often overlook.

By correctly including these contributions in the SMSF’s servicing assessment, the borrowing capacity increased even further.

4. Complete Lending Strategy & Compliance Alignment

We structured a lending plan that:

Met SIS and LRBA compliance requirements

Aligned with the SMSF’s investment strategy

Ensured sufficient liquidity buffers

Delivered lender confidence and clarity

With the correct structure and lender selection, the application was approved without issue.

The Positive Outcome

✔ The client was approved for the full loan amount—despite being turned away elsewhere
✔ 40-year loan term maximised affordability and borrowing power
✔ Voluntary contributions included, dramatically improving servicing
✔ SMSF successfully purchased a high-quality investment property
✔ Long-term retirement wealth strengthened through improved SMSF asset growth
