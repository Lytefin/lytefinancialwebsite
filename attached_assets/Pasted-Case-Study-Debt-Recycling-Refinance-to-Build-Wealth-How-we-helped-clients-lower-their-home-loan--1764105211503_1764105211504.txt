Case Study: Debt Recycling & Refinance to Build Wealth

How we helped clients lower their home loan costs and turn personal savings into a tax-effective investment strategy.

The Client’s Goal

Clients: Jason & Emily, Melbourne VIC
Goal: Reduce non-deductible home loan interest and build long-term wealth through strategic investing.

Jason & Emily were financially stable and motivated to grow their wealth. They had accumulated a significant cash buffer and wanted to put their money to work—without increasing their overall financial risk.

The Client’s Challenge

The couple held:

$250,000 in cash savings, sitting idle

A home loan with a higher-than-necessary interest rate

Although they wanted to invest, doing so directly from their savings would leave them paying unnecessary non-deductible interest on their mortgage. They needed a structure that:

Reduced their home loan costs

Freed up capital for investing

Made future interest tax-deductible

Stayed within their comfort level and long-term goals

They required a strategic and compliant way to restructure their finances for maximum efficiency.

Our Strategic Solution
1. Refinancing the Existing Home Loan to Reduce Costs

We refinanced their home loan to a lender offering a lower interest rate, immediately reducing their monthly repayments and long-term interest costs.

2. Using Their $250,000 to Eliminate Non-Deductible Debt

We applied their $250,000 savings directly against the newly refinanced home loan. This significantly reduced their non-deductible debt—improving their financial position from day one.

3. Establishing a New Investment Loan (Debt Recycling Structure)

To ensure their investment strategy remained tax-efficient, we set up a new $250,000 loan against their property for investment purposes.
This allowed them to:

Keep their home loan as low as possible

Use separate loan splits for clarity and compliance

Begin investing without affecting personal cash flow

4. Creating a Long-Term, Tax-Effective Investment Plan

The new loan was used to invest in diversified assets, including shares and managed funds.
Because the borrowed funds were used for investing, the interest on the new loan became tax-deductible—transforming what once was “bad debt” into “good debt.”

We also created a clear roadmap for future debt recycling, allowing Jason & Emily to grow their investments as their home loan reduces over time.

The Positive Outcome

A smart, long-term wealth strategy with immediate financial benefits:

✔ Lower Interest on Their Home Loan

Refinancing reduced their repayments and saved thousands in future interest.

✔ Converted $250,000 of Non-Deductible Debt Into Tax-Deductible Debt

Their money now works harder—reducing tax and improving long-term returns.

✔ A Structured Investment Plan for Wealth Growth

They now hold a well-designed investment portfolio funded through an efficient debt strategy.

✔ Improved Long-Term Cash Flow

By reducing non-deductible interest, more of their money goes toward wealth creation.

✔ Clear, Sustainable Financial Framework

The structure allows them to continue recycling debt and expanding their investment base over time.
