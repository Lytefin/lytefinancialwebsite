Here are the instructions for the SMSF Lending box, incorporating the five-stage process.

🏛️ SMSF Lending Process
When you click into the SMSF Lending box, the following five-stage process will guide the client through securing a loan for their Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF).

Stage 1: Assessment & Initial Documentation
This stage focuses on understanding the SMSF's financial standing and gathering the necessary initial paperwork.

Assessment of SMSF Borrowing Capacity: Determine the maximum amount the SMSF can responsibly borrow based on its current assets, contributions, and anticipated rental income from the purchased property.

Initial Documentation Gathering: Collect essential documents, including:

SMSF Trust Deed (current version)

Financial statements for the last two years

Member statements

Identification for all trustees/directors

Stage 2: Strategy & Structuring
This is the planning phase, ensuring the SMSF is structured correctly for borrowing and optimizing fund sourcing.

Reviewing Current Deposits: Analyze the funds currently available within the SMSF for the deposit and associated costs.

Alternative Equity Options: Suggest potential strategies to access equity from existing properties held personally or in other entities, if required, to supplement the SMSF deposit.

Strategic On-Lending: Explore the option of a related party loan (on-lending) to the SMSF from a member's personal funds, provided all compliance requirements are met (e.g., commercial terms).

Involvement of Key Stakeholders: Engage relevant professionals early (e.g., accountant, solicitor) to ensure the correct legal and compliance structure is established. This is critical for:

Creation of a Bare Trust (Custody Trust).

Ensuring the SMSF Trust Deed permits borrowing.

Preparation of all required compliance documents.

Stage 3: Application Submission
Once the strategy and structure are confirmed, the focus shifts to selecting and applying to the best lender.

Lender Selection: Based on the SMSF's purchase requirements (e.g., property type, loan-to-value ratio, interest rate preference), select the window (lender) that offers the most suitable terms and conditions.

Application Packaging: Compile the comprehensive loan application package, including all financial, trust, and property documentation.

Formal Submission: Submit the complete application to the chosen lender.

Stage 4: Execution & Settlement
This stage involves managing the application through to final settlement and ensuring absolute compliance.

Application to Settlement Management: Closely track the application's progress, responding promptly to lender queries and conditions.

Compliant Documentation: Ensure all final trust documentation, including the Bare Trust Deed and loan agreements, are correctly executed and compliant with SIS (Superannuation Industry Supervision) legislation.

Coordination with Key Stakeholders: Maintain close liaison with the client, selling agent, solicitor, and lender to ensure a smooth and timely settlement process.

Settlement: Finalize the purchase and drawdown the loan.

Stage 5: Post-Settlement & Growth Strategy
The final stage involves follow-up and forward-looking advice.

Onwards Review: Conduct a post-settlement review to confirm all loan and compliance requirements have been met.

Future Growth Strategies: Provide suggestions and strategies for the growth of the SMSF's funds moving forward, such as:

Reviewing the loan structure for future refinances.

Optimizing contribution strategies.

Ongoing property performance assessment.
