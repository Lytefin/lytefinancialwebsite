Given the upwardly moving market, they did not want to sell and be stuck renting, potentially missing out on desirable properties.Our SolutionThe Strategy: We assisted the clients in securing a solution that allowed them to hold both properties for a period of six months.The Mechanism: This was achieved via a Bridging Finance Facility. The lender was able to advance the funds for the new purchase based on peak debt and equity levels.The Outcome: This solution provided the clients with the flexibility to get into their new home first and sufficient time (up to 6 months) to sell their existing property without market pressure.3.
