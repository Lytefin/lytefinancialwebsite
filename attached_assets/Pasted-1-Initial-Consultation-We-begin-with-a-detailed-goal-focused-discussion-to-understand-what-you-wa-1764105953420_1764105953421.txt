1. Initial Consultation

We begin with a detailed, goal-focused discussion to understand what you want to achieve — whether you're buying, upgrading, refinancing, investing, or restructuring your lending.
This session helps us understand your priorities, challenges, and the most suitable direction for the lending strategy ahead.

2. Information Collection & Financial Assessment

You’ll receive secure access to your Lyte Financial client portal to complete your fact find and upload key documents.
From there, we assess your borrowing capacity, income position, deposit or equity, liabilities, and long-term goals — forming a complete picture of your financial position.

3. Strategy & Recommendation Meeting

Once our analysis is complete, we meet with you to present a personalised lending strategy.
We walk you through tailored options, compare lenders and structures, and explain how each approach supports your objectives.
This is a collaborative session designed to give you clarity and confidence before moving forward.

4. Lending Proposal & Application Submission

You’ll receive a detailed proposal outlining the recommended lender, loan structure, repayments, and projected benefits.
Once you're comfortable with the plan, we prepare and submit your application — managing all communication with the lender, valuers, and key parties to ensure everything progresses smoothly.

5. Loan Approval, Settlement & Completion

After your loan is approved, we guide you through the final requirements and coordinate with all stakeholders, including the lender and your solicitor.
We manage the full settlement process, ensuring your transition into the new loan or property is seamless and stress-free.

6. Ongoing Support, Reviews & Strategic Guidance

Our partnership continues well beyond settlement.
We provide ongoing reviews, rate check-ins, structure optimisation, equity assessments, and strategic advice to ensure your lending remains competitive and aligned with your goals over time.
As your life, income, or plans evolve — we ensure your finance evolves with you.
